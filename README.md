# plot-gas-cromatography
Parses GC (tabbed or csv) data and plots the spectra with annotated peaks  
The parameter "N" indicates how many values to the side will use to check if the value is a maximum.  
It does shrink the data in that number at the start and at the end so if you have peaks near edges be careful.
